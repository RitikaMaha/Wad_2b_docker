# 🐳 Docker Assignment

## 📘 What is Docker?

**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables developers to **build, package, and run applications in containers**. Containers are lightweight, portable units that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers share the host system's OS kernel and are much more efficient in terms of resource usage. This makes it easier to ensure that the application will run the same way, regardless of where it's deployed — development machine, test environment, or production server.
